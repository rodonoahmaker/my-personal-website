  <div class="mb-10">
      With over 5 years of experience as a Product Manager in startup software development, I specialize in driving growth through Experimentation & Analytics. My focus on strategic product initiatives and rigorous A/B testing has consistently delivered significant revenue increases and measurable impact across various companies. <br>
    <br>
    My deep passion for technology, programming, and design directly informs my product management approach. Proficient in Python (including some Django), SQL, and UI prototyping with Figma, I thrive on involvement from the ground up, from initial sketches and wireframes that spark productive discussions with design and engineering, to crafting A/B tests grounded in strong design rationale. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This hands-on technical aptitude extends to detailed task specification, rigorous QA, and both simple and advanced data analyses. Occasionally, I also contribute to script writing and debugging, which enhances team capabilities and helps bridge the gap between product, engineering, and design.
